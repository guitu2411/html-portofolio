<h1>I'm Gil, a Web developer going in full motion to become a Full Stack Developer,</h1>
<p>Born in Brazil, looking for the hint in life to what go for I discovered that my way of thinking was always too analitical, too technical and i should use it in a way where it can be used. </p>

<p>Programming, writing code, creating and finding patterns is my way of life, so here starts my journey.</p>

<p> Transforming 0 and 1 in art.</p>
